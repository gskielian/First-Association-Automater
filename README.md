First-Association-Automater
===========================

This is a project for automating first associations using the Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus in xml, using the Python xml tools.

The idea will be to create a custom vocabulary curriculum for a student applying techniques from spaced-repetition and novel applications of abstract algebras.
